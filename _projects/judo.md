[Judo](https://judo.qcri.org/) is a high-performance web application designed for visualizing large-scale traffic simulation data generated by [QarSUMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03289), QCRI's distributed traffic simulation platform built on top of the open-source [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) microsimulator.

## Architecture

The application features a full-stack architecture that ingests QarSUMO/SUMO simulation outputs into a [PostGIS](https://postgis.net) geospatial database, served through a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) backend and rendered via an [Angular](https://angular.io) frontend with [PIXI.js](https://pixijs.com) for hardware-accelerated graphics.

## Key Contributions

**System Implementation**
Implemented full-stack video playback of simulations on browser, including server-side rendering to reduce dependance on client system.

**Performance Optimization**
Engineered a web-based visualization system capable of handling over 1 million vehicles simultaneously, implementing critical performance features including:
  - Intelligent vehicle clustering algorithms
  - Adaptive frame dropping mechanisms  
  - Memory-efficient buffering strategies
  - Achieved 10x performance improvement (3 FPS â†’ 30 FPS at scale)

**Infrastructure & Deployment**
Containerized QarSUMO using Docker and developed a RESTful API interface to enable seamless deployment and horizontal scalability. Also implemented CI/CD pipelines in Microsoft Azure to deploy the system using Docker Swarm.
